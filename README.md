### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Vinicius and I work as a Full Stack Software Engineer. I am completely passionate about this profession because I love to create, fix and improve things. It is wonderful to see something that you made or improved making a difference in people's life. My mission is to solve problems and make things better by creating good and reliable software. To do so, I have in my belt some tools such as TDD, DDD, SOLID, Design Patterns, Javascript, Typescript and Java. But I don't let this limit myself. I believe that once you know the fundamentals and best practices you can carry out your experience to any language. That is why I never stop learning and keep improving myself. The goal is to be the best that I can and then, keep getting better. ðŸ˜ƒ
